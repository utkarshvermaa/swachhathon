Repo for Nirmal App
_________________________________________________
Key point for Nirmal App - Swachhathon:
1. Ionic app; App khulte hi homescreen par user ki location ki hisaab se MAP aa jaaye (Uber types), and nearby public toilets are highlighted.
2. Nearby toilets ke liye ek database dhoondna hoga (Sulabh + Other places such as (Restaurants and Shopping Malls)
3. Starting mein hygiene score sabka average rakh dete hain, lets say 3 out of 5.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Itna sab home screen par hoga. Iske baad aata hai complaints and ratings/reviews wala section.
Now, complaints ke liye ek alag view banate hain, jismei do options honge
    i. Maintenance (with media sharing)
    ii. Application for a New Toilet (With location, and distance from nearest available toilet)
    iii. Delete a toilet from our database (in case koi toilet is not functional anymore)
Review we have to keep very simple, bass kaunsa toilet use kara and 5 starts mei se select karlo.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Then comes this report generation waala part. We have to take into consideration, the average hygiene score of the toilets and requests for new toilets from that area. Jaha par bhi score 3 se kam hai, those will be mentioned in the report and all the localities from where naye toilets ki request aayi hai will also be mentioned. Isko leke generate an alert for us area ka authority and email karde usse report.
